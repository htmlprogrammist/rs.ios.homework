# Min Rotated Sorted array

Find the minimum in an rotated sorted array of unique nums with unknown pivot. 

**Time complexity must be O(logN)**

- [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] rotated 1 times results [5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] rotated 2 times results [4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3]
- [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] rotated 3 times results [3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2]
