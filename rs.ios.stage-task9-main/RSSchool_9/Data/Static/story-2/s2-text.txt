There was a little smart Bird in a tree.

A big grey Cat came to the tree. He saw the little Bird and wanted to eat her.

“I’ll have the bird for my breakfast”, thought the Cat.

“Good morning, Miss Bird”, said the Cat with a pleasant voice.

“Good morning, Mr. Cat”, answered the Bird.

“Have you heard the good news?” asked the Cat.

“What news?” said the Bird.

The Cat answered with a smile: “Very good news, my little Bird! All animals are good friends now! We are friends: all cats, dogs and birds. Come to me! I want to speak to you, my friend!”

But the little Bird was very smart. She said:

“Of course, you are my friend. But I see a lot of dogs from my tree and they are on their way to this tree.”

“Oh, dogs!.. I must go home!” exclaimed the Cat.

“But why are you leaving, my dear friend? The dogs are our friends, too,” said the Bird.

“I think they haven’t heard the news”, answered the Cat and ran home.
